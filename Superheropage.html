        <p> My skill is nice to editing image,video and take photo.On my seconder school,i always join competiton editing logo and anything else.I also became PRS (PEMIMBING RAKAN SEBAYA) .For me , i learn all of experince what i do .</p>

For me i choose superhero wonder women because she is character drew a great deal of inspiration.The girl who wondered has seen wonders.She has become a woman who has traveled the world, who has traveled worlds! A woman who has touched countless lives, has made them better in ways beyond measure. A woman who has brought hope, and joy, and love. A woman who is the hero of so many.  </p>
<p align = "center"> I also like for she  has a high resistance to damage and magical attacks. His resistance to injury is not as great as Superman or Supergirl. Still, because of the wide pain threshold and its ability to heal the Amazon at a super rate, this easily makes up for the difference. He has suffered a lot of damage in the form of hand-to-hand battles with metahuman opponents like Superman and Shazam. .</p>
